At that point, if any player moves before the effect decays it will chain geometrically, as both Curse Family and Acrid Hands will most likely be already active. This will blow up the raid, causing multiple base kilodamage with significant overdamage lingering. (This is particularly true on Spoltog and Pemptus, where trilobite familiars are disadvantageous in mountain marsh biomes.)<p>So as a public service I've put together this reminder to keep still until Big Sister winds down.

Funny story, really, if you think about it hard enough.
Progress Quest's webhost seems to have dropped off the
face of the earth (forever, I hope, and curse them to hell).
Our offsite backups are weeks old, so that turns back the
clock on new characters, new guilds, guild changes, and new user accounts
from October 27 through most of November.
Older characters should not lose any progress from the intervening
time.  Sadly, there are no offsite backups at all of the
PQ Forum, which is therefore making a fresh start.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We apologize for any loss of progress you may have experienced.

     has just been introduced.
     Unlike with <a href=https://progressquest.com/spoltog.php>Spoltog</a>, the beta realm,
     login is not required to create characters in Expodrine.
     Meanwhile, it is now no longer possible to create characters
     in Progress Quest's oldest realm, <a href=https://progressquest.com/knoram.php>Knoram</a>.
     This means that players with the old version of the game must
     <a href=./dl.php>download the latest version of Progres Quest</a>
     to be able to create new online characters.<br><font color=#202080>[April 20, 2002]</font></table></p><p align=center><table width=80%><tr><td><b><font color=#202080>Progress Quest article in CGM</font></b><br>Progress Quest is featured in an article
